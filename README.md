# COMP228-the-chase-app
An app imitating the gameplay loop of 'The Chase' TV show for an assignment. 

Players must choose between a 'high', 'middle', and 'low' offer on the ladder to act as their score. This score determines their starting position. From here, both the player and the Chaser must answer trivia questions to move down the ladder. If the player can reach the bottom of the ladder before the chaser reaches them, they win. 

Created using XCode and Swift.
